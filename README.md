# my_css_battle

Just saving here my [CSS Batle](https://cssbattle.dev/) solutions in a decent way.
These implementations have nothing to do with code golf, I just liked these challenging shapes and also wanted to do some recreational activity. I aimed to write "real world" pure css.

In order the code work inside CSS Batle's editor, one may has to replace the container class rules to a body rule, e.g. like this:

    <style>
      body {
        margin: 0;
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        background: <color>;
      }
      </style>
