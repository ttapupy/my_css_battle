Just saving here my [CSS Batle](https://cssbattle.dev/) solutions in a decent way.
These implementations have nothing to do with code golf, I just liked these challenging shapes! My aim was to write real world css.

In order the code work inside CSS Batle's editor, one may have to replace the container class rules to a body rule, e.g. like this:

    <style>
      body {
        margin: 0;
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        background: <color>;
      }
      </style>
